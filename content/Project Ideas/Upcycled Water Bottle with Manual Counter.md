### Feasibility for a Hobbyist:

As a hobbyist, creating a water bottle with a mechanical slide indicator is definitely within reach, especially if you enjoy working with your hands and have some basic tools and materials. Here’s a breakdown of how you might approach it:

#### Materials and Tools:
- **Upcycled Bottle**: Start with a glass or plastic bottle from a product you already use. Glass bottles from juices or other beverages could work well.
- **Mechanical Slide Parts**: You can repurpose old sliding mechanisms from things like window blinds, drawer slides, or even old mechanical counters.
- **Decorative Elements**: Upcycled metal, wood, or even plastic can be used to create the aesthetic elements. Look for items like old furniture parts, scrap metal, or even discarded electronics for small gears and components.
- **Tools**: Basic tools like a Dremel, glue gun, small files, and pliers will be handy. You might also need a drill and fine saw if you're working with wood or metal.

#### Construction Steps:
1. **Prepare the Bottle**:
   - Clean and dry the upcycled bottle. If using glass, you can sand the surface lightly to help with the attachment of other components.
   - Decide where the mechanical slide will go and mark the position on the bottle.

2. **Create the Slide Mechanism**:
   - Use an old sliding mechanism from an upcycled item, modifying it to fit the bottle. Attach numbers or indicators that will be visible through a window cut into the bottle or through a small attached frame.
   - If you're crafting it yourself, consider using thin wood or metal strips that slide within a small track or groove attached to the bottle.

3. **Attach the Mechanism**:
   - Secure the slide mechanism to the bottle using a strong adhesive or small screws (if working with a material like wood). Ensure it’s properly aligned and moves smoothly.
   - Create a window for the numbers to be visible, either by cutting into the bottle or attaching a frame on the bottle’s surface.

4. **Add Decorative Elements**:
   - Use upcycled metal, wire, or small gears to create the steampunk aesthetic. These can be glued or soldered onto the bottle.
   - For the solarpunk theme, you could weave in natural fibers, attach small upcycled wooden pieces, or even paint natural patterns using eco-friendly paints.

5. **Finish and Seal**:
   - Ensure all parts are securely attached and that the slide mechanism works reliably. Seal any exposed edges to prevent wear.
   - Optionally, coat the bottle in a protective finish to enhance durability and give it a polished look.

### Modified Description with Upcycled Materials:

#### Vivid Description:

The water bottle is a vision of sustainable innovation, crafted from upcycled materials and designed to inspire a connection with nature. The main body of the bottle is a repurposed glass vessel, rescued from its former life and given new purpose. Its surface bears the gentle, irregular texture of hand-polished glass, with the soft sheen of light green, reminiscent of sea glass found along a shoreline.

#### Mechanical Slide Indicator:
- **Slide Mechanism**: The slide indicator is crafted from upcycled metal strips, salvaged from old household items or electronics. The numbers are stamped into the metal or painted using eco-friendly paint, visible through a small frame made from reclaimed wood or metal. The slide moves with a satisfying click, each position marked by a small upcycled gear that locks it in place.

#### Solarpunk Aesthetic:
- **Decorative Elements**: The bottle is adorned with delicate, intertwined vines made from twisted wire, rescued from old electronics or scrap materials. These vines wrap gracefully around the bottle, symbolizing the blend of nature and technology. Small, polished metal leaves or flowers, once part of discarded jewelry or decorations, are carefully attached, adding a touch of organic elegance.
- **Cap Design**: The cap is fashioned from repurposed metal, with a soft patina that speaks to its history. It features an engraved pattern of leaves, hand-etched into the surface, giving it a tactile, rustic feel.

#### Sustainability and Message:
- **Inscriptions**: Alongside the slide, small, engraved symbols or words remind the user of the importance of reuse and connection with the earth. These might be carved into reclaimed wood pieces attached to the bottle or stamped into metal bands that encircle its base.

This upcycled water bottle not only tracks your hydration but tells a story of renewal and creativity, turning what was once discarded into a functional piece of art.

### Feasibility:
Crafting this bottle is certainly possible for a hobbyist, especially if you enjoy creative reuse of materials. The project would allow you to experiment with various crafting techniques, from metalworking to basic mechanical assembly, making it a fulfilling and unique endeavor.
